# Advent of Code ðŸ¥²

This repository contains my solutions to the Advent of Code challenges, starting from 2015. Advent of Code is an annual event that features a series of programming puzzles released daily in December.

## Structure

- **<insertyear>/**: Contains the source code for each year's solutions, day.
- **README.md**: This file, providing an overview of the repository and how to use the solutions.

## Usage

To run a specific day's solution:

1. Navigate to the year's directory under.
2. Navigate to the day's directory.
3. Run the solution using Go.

For example, to run the solution for Day 1 of 2015:

```bash
cd src/2015/day01
go run main.go
```

### Disclaimer
I am doing this whiles learning golang so the code wouldn't be efficient at all lol ðŸ˜†.
Don't come for me I beg. ðŸ’€
